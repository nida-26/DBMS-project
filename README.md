# Hotel-Management-System
The **Hotel Booking Management System** is an DBMS based project designed to streamline hotel operations such as check-in, check-out, and room bookings. Built with **PHP** and a **MySQL database**, the system efficiently manages room availability by storing details of all hotel rooms, including categories and daily rates. 

The system is divided into two modules:  
1. **Admin Module** - Allows hotel management to handle room details, update records, manage bookings, and process payments.  
2. **User Module** - Simplified interface for customers to view and book available rooms.

With its user-friendly design, this system ensures ease of use for both administrators and customers, enhancing the overall hotel management experience.
